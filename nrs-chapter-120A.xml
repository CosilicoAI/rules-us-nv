          <content>
            <p>A record of the issuance of
a check, draft or similar instrument is prima facie evidence of an obligation.
In claiming property from a holder who is also the issuer, the Administratorï¿½s
burden of proof as to the existence and amount of the property and its
abandonment is satisfied by showing issuance of the instrument and passage of
the requisite period of abandonment. Defenses of payment, satisfaction,
discharge and want of consideration are affirmative defenses that must be
established by the holder.</p>
