subsection 1, an owner of agriculturally assessed land who wishes to have a
portion of a parcel converted to a higher use rather than the entire parcel must
record and transmit to the county assessor a survey of the portion of the
parcel to be converted. The survey must be transmitted to the county assessor
at the same time as the notice required by subsection 1. The recordation of a
survey pursuant to this subsection does not create a new parcel.

          <content>
            <p>When any portion of
agricultural or open-space land is converted to a higher use, the county
assessor shall determine its taxable and, as appropriate, agricultural or
open-space use values against which to compute the deferred tax for each fiscal
year the property was under agricultural or open-space assessment during the
current fiscal year and the preceding 6 fiscal years, or such other period as
is required pursuant toNRS 361A.283.
The taxable values for each year must be comparable for the corresponding years
to the taxable values for property similar, including, without limitation, in
size, zoning and location, to the portion of property actually converted to a
higher use. When agricultural land is converted to a higher use, the
agricultural use values for each of the years may be based on the agricultural
use for the latest year. When open-space land that is used as a golf course is
converted to a higher use, the taxable values for the property must be
determined, for the purpose of computing the deferred tax, in accordance with
the provisions ofNRS 361.227based upon
the assessment of the land as a golf course.</p>

property which has received agricultural or open-space use assessment has been

and the taxes which would have been paid or payable on the basis of the taxable
value calculated pursuant toNRS 361A.277for each year in which agricultural or open-space use assessment was in effect
for the property during the fiscal year in which the property ceased to be used
exclusively for agricultural use or approved open-space use and the preceding 6
fiscal years. The county assessor shall assess the property pursuant toNRS 361.227for the next fiscal year
