30 days if not terminated previously by a health authority. At the end of the
court-ordered period of isolation or quarantine, the health authority may
petition to renew the detention of the person for additional periods which each
must not exceed the shorter of 120 days or either, if the person is isolated,
the period of time which the health authority expects the person will be
infectious with the communicable disease or, if the person is quarantined, the
period of time which the health authority determines is necessary to determine
whether the person has been infected with the communicable disease. For each
renewal, the petition must set forth to the court specific reasons why further
isolation or quarantine is appropriate and that the person likely poses an
ongoing immediate threat to the health of the public. If the court finds in
considering a petition for renewal that the person is noncompliant with a
court-ordered measure to control or resolve the risk of transmitting the
communicable disease, it may order the continued isolation and treatment of the
person for any period of time the court deems necessary to resolve the
immediate and ongoing risk of the person transmitting the disease.
