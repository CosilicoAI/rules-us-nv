              <p>A governmental agency issuing or
seeking a subpoena to obtain financial records may petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to order that service upon the customer or the 10-day
period provided in subsection 1 be waived or shortened. The court may issue the
order upon a showing that the agency can reasonably infer from facts relevant
to its investigation of the customer that a law subject to the agencyï¿½s
jurisdiction has been or is about to be violated. In granting a petition to
waive service upon the customer, the court shall also order the agency to
notify the customer in writing within a period determined by the court, but not
to exceed 90 days. The notice shall specify the name of the agency in whose
name the subpoena was issued, the financial records which were examined under
the subpoena and the statutory purpose for which the information was obtained.
The time of notification may be extended for additional 45-day periods upon
petition and good cause shown.
