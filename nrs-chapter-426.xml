              <p>For the purposes of subsection 1, if a
recipient of services pursuant to the provisions of this chapter receives an
overpayment for the third time and the overpayments have resulted from a false
statement or representation by the recipient or from the failure of the
recipient to notify the Bureau of a change in his or her circumstances which
would affect the amount of services the person receives, a rebuttable
presumption arises that the payment was fraudulently received.</p>
