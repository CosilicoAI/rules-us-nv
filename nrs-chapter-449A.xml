            <p>A declaration directing a physician or

treatment may, but need not, be in the following form:
DECLARATION
If I should have an incurable and
irreversible condition that, without the administration of life-sustaining
treatment, will, in the opinion of my attending physician or attending advanced
practice registered nurse, cause my death within a relatively short time, and I
am no longer able to make decisions regarding my medical treatment, I direct my
attending physician or attending advanced practice registered nurse, pursuant
toNRS 449A.400to449A.481, inclusive, to withhold or
withdraw treatment that only prolongs the process of dying and is not necessary
for my comfort or to alleviate pain.
If you wish to include this
statement in this declaration, you must INITIAL the statement in the box
provided:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Withholding or withdrawal of
artificial nutrition and hydration may result in death by starvation or
dehydration. Initial this box if you want to receive or continue receiving
artificial nutrition and hydration by way of the gastrointestinal tract after
all other treatment is withheld pursuant to this declaration.

person to make decisions governing the withholding or withdrawal of
life-sustaining treatment may, but need not, be in the following form:
DECLARATION
If I should have an incurable and
irreversible condition that, without the administration of life-sustaining
treatment, will, in the opinion of my attending physician or attending advanced
practice registered nurse, cause my death within a relatively short time, and I
am no longer able to make decisions regarding my medical treatment, I appoint
............................... or, if he or she is not reasonably available or
is unwilling to serve, .............................., to make decisions on my
behalf regarding withholding or withdrawal of treatment that only prolongs the
process of dying and is not necessary for my comfort or to alleviate pain,
pursuant toNRS 449A.400to449A.481, inclusive. (If the person or
persons I have so appointed are not reasonably available or are unwilling to
serve, I direct my attending physician or attending advanced practice
registered nurse, pursuant to those sections, to withhold or withdraw treatment
that only prolongs the process of dying and is not necessary for my comfort or
to alleviate pain.)
Strike language in parentheses if
you do not desire it.
If you wish to include this
statement in this declaration, you must INITIAL the statement in the box

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Withholding or withdrawal of

          <content>
            <p>An advance directive for psychiatric care
becomes operative when it is communicated to a physician or any other provider
of health care and the principal is determined by two providers of health care,
one of whom must be the attending physician or a licensed psychologist and the
other of whom must be a physician, a physician assistant, a licensed
psychologist, a psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who has
the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
Nursing pursuant toNRS 632.120, to be
no longer able to make or communicate decisions regarding the provision of
psychiatric care. If the principal is determined to be no longer able to make
or communicate decisions regarding the provision of psychiatric care and
subsequently the principalï¿½s attending physician or an advance practice
registered nurse who has the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by
the State Board of Nursing pursuant toNRS
632.120and has an established relationship with the principal determines
that the principal has regained the ability to make or communicate decisions
regarding the provision of psychiatric care, the advance directive is no longer
operative. When the advance directive is operative, a physician and any other
provider of health care shall act in accordance with the provisions of the
advance directive and with the instructions of a person designated pursuant toNRS 449A.618, or comply with the
requirements ofNRS 449A.639to
transfer the care of the principal.</p>
