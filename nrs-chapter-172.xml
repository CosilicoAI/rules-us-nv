            <p>A district judge may impanel a grand jury to
inquire into a specific limited matter among those set forth inNRS 172.175. In that case, the judge shall
charge the grand jury as to its limited duties and give it such information as
the judge deems necessary. A grand jury that is impaneled for a specific
limited purpose shall not inquire into matters not related to that purpose. A
grand jury impaneled for a specific limited purpose may be discharged after the
grand jury completes its investigation and submits its report. If the grand
jury has not completed its investigation and submitted its report within 1 year
after it was impaneled, it shall, in a closed hearing, show cause to the judge
why it should not be discharged. If the judge determines that it is in the
public interest for the grand jury to continue its investigation, the grand
jury may continue for a period which does not exceed 1 year.</p>

State of Nevada committed or triable within this county, (or city, in the case
of Carson City) of which you shall have or can obtain legal evidence. You will
keep your own counsel, and that of your fellows and the Government, and will
not, except when required in the due course of judicial proceedings, disclose
the testimony of any witness examined before you, nor anything which you or any
other grand juror may have said, nor the manner in which you or any other grand
juror may have voted on any matter before you. You will present no person
through malice, hatred, or ill will, nor leave any unpresented through fear,
favor, or affection, or for any reward, or the promise or hope thereof; but in
all your presentments you will present the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, according to the best of your skill and understanding, so help
you God.</p>
