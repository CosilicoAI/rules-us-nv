days after the date when notice should have been served, unless exercised by

              <p>Electric utilities report that foil balloons
are among the top causes of outages. Foil balloons are coated with a shiny
metallic film that conducts electricity. If a foil balloon contacts power
lines, this can create an electrical fault that can damage power lines, cause
blackouts and start fires.

              <p>Any merchant who has reason to believe
that merchandise has been wrongfully taken by a person and that the merchant
can recover the merchandise by taking the person into custody and detaining the
person may, for the purpose of attempting to effect such recovery or for the
purpose of informing a peace officer of the circumstances of such detention,
take the person into custody and detain the person, on the premises, in a
reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time. A merchant is presumed
to have reason to believe that merchandise has been wrongfully taken by a person
and that the merchant can recover the merchandise by taking the person into
custody and detaining the person if the merchant observed the person concealing
merchandise while on the premises. Such taking into custody and detention by a
merchant does not render the merchant criminally or civilly liable for false
arrest, false imprisonment, slander or unlawful detention unless the taking
into custody and detention are unreasonable under all the circumstances.
