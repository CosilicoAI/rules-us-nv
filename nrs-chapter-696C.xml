              <p>During the period an insurer is under
administrative supervision pursuant toNRS
696C.100, the insurer may contest any action taken or proposed to be taken
by the administrative supervisor designated pursuant to subsection 1 ofNRS 696C.110on the ground that the
action would not result in improving the condition of the insurer. To contest
an action taken or proposed to be taken by the administrative supervisor, the
insurer must submit a request for reconsideration to the administrative
supervisor. If the administrative supervisor, upon reconsideration, denies the
insurerï¿½s request, the insurer may request a review of the decision of the
administrative supervisor pursuant toNRS
679B.310to679B.370, inclusive.
