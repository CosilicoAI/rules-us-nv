addition to the notice requirements set forth inNRS 604D.260, a licensee must, before
making a change in the principal officers or directors of a licensee, submit a
notice to the Commissioner within a time period prescribed by the Commissioner.
If the submission of such a notice is not possible before the change due to the
unilateral resignation of a principal officer or director or other similar
circumstance, the licensee must submit to the Commissioner a notice as promptly
as possible after such a change. If, in the reasonable judgment of the
Commissioner, the change in the principal officers or directors of the licensee
is inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter, the Commissioner may
require the licensee to take such action as the Commissioner deems necessary to
ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
