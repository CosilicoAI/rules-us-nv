              <p>In addition to the tax levied pursuant
toNRS 428.185and428.285and any tax levied pursuant toNRS 450.425, the board of county
commissioners of a county shall, at the time provided for the adoption of its
final budget, levy an ad valorem tax to provide aid and relief to those persons
coming within the purview of this chapter. In a county whose population is
700,000 or more, this levy must not exceed that adopted for the purposes of
this chapter for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971, diminished by 12.3 cents
for each $100 of assessed valuation. In a county whose population is less than
700,000 the rate of the tax must be calculated to produce not more than the
amount of money allocated pursuant toNRS
428.295.
