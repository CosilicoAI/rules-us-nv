to this chapter, the board of county commissioners of a county whose population
is less than 700,000 or a county whose population is 700,000 or more and in
which no water authority exists, shall develop a plan for the expenditure of
the proceeds of a tax imposed pursuant to this chapter for the purposes set
forth inNRS 377B.160. The plan may
include a regional project for which two or more such counties have entered
into an interlocal agreement to expend jointly all or a portion of the proceeds
of a tax imposed in each county pursuant to this chapter. Such a plan must include,
without limitation, the date on which the plan expires, a description of each
proposed project, the method of financing each project and the costs related to
each project. Before adopting a plan pursuant to this subsection, the board of
county commissioners of a county in which a regional planning commission has
been established pursuant toNRS 278.0262shall transmit to the regional planning commission a list of the proposed
projects for which a tax for infrastructure may be imposed. The regional
planning commission shall hold a public hearing at which it shall rank each
project in relative priority. The regional planning commission shall transmit
its rankings to the board of county commissioners. The recommendations of the
regional planning commission regarding the priority of the proposed projects
are not binding on the board of county commissioners. The board of county
commissioners shall hold at least one public hearing on the plan. Notice of the
time and place of the hearing must be provided in the manner set forth in
subsection 6. The plan must be approved by the board of county commissioners at
a public hearing. Subject to the provisions of subsection 9, on or before the
date on which a plan expires, the board of county commissioners shall determine
whether a necessity exists for the continued imposition of the tax. If the
board determines that such a necessity does not exist, the board shall repeal
the ordinance that enacted the tax. If the board of county commissioners
determines that the tax must be continued for a purpose set forth inNRS 377B.160, the board shall adopt, in
the manner prescribed in this subsection, a new plan for the expenditure of the
proceeds of the tax for such a purpose.
