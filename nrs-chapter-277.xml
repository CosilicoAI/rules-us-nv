and 1982, no city or county may issue building permits which authorize
construction of a greater square footage of new commercial buildings within the
region than were authorized within the region by building permits for
commercial purposes issued by that city or county during the calendar year
1978. For the period of January through April, 1983, building permits
authorizing the construction of no more than one-third the amount of that
square footage may be issued by each such city or county.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The legislatures find the respective square footages of
commercial buildings authorized within the region during calendar year 1978 to
be as follows:

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (5) No structure may be erected to house gaming
under a nonrestricted license.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (6) No facility for the treatment of sewage may
be constructed or enlarged except:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (A) To comply, as ordered by the appropriate
state agency for the control of water pollution, with existing limitations of
effluent under the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 1251 et seq., and the
applicable state law for control of water pollution;
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (B) To accommodate development which is not
prohibited or limited by this subdivision; or
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (C) In the case of Douglas County Lake Tahoe
Sewer Authority, to modify or otherwise alter sewage treatment facilities
existing on the effective date of the amendments to this compact so that such
facilities will be able to treat the total volume of effluent for which they
were originally designed, which is 3.0 million gallons per day. Such
modification or alteration is not a ï¿½projectï¿½; is not subject to the
requirements of Article VII; and does not require a permit from the agency.
Before commencing such modification or alteration, however, the Authority shall
submit to the agency its report identifying any significant soil erosion
problems which may be caused by such modifications or alterations and the
measures which the Authority proposes to take to mitigate or avoid such
problems.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The moratorium imposed by this subdivision does not
apply to work done pursuant to a right vested before the effective date of the
amendments to this compact. Notwithstanding the expiration date of the
moratorium imposed by this subdivision, no new highway may be built or existing
highway widened to accommodate additional continuous lanes for automobiles
until the regional transportation plan is revised and adopted.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The moratorium imposed by this subdivision does not
apply to the construction of any parking garage which has been approved by the
agency prior to May 4, 1979, whether that approval was affirmative or by
default. The provisions of this paragraph are not an expression of legislative
intent that any such parking garage, the approval of which is the subject of
litigation which was pending on the effective date of the amendments to this
compact, should or should not be constructed. The provisions of this paragraph
are intended solely to permit construction of such a parking garage if a
judgment sustaining the agencyï¿½s approval to construct that parking garage has
become final and no appeal is pending or may lawfully be taken to a higher
court.

of the structure which requires a permit from a local government also requires
approval from the agency. The agency shall not permit restaurants, convention
facilities, showrooms or other public areas to be constructed elsewhere in the
region outside the structure in order to replace areas existing or approved for
public use on May 4, 1979.

adoption a tax for the purpose of obtaining services of the district. The tax
proposed must be general and of uniform operation throughout the region, and
may not be graduated in any way, except for a sales and use tax. If a sales and
use tax is approved by the voters as provided in this paragraph, it may be
administered by the states of California and Nevada respectively in accordance
with the laws that apply within their respective jurisdictions and must not
exceed a rate of 1 percent of the gross receipts from the sale of tangible
personal property sold in the district. The district is prohibited from
imposing any other tax measured by gross or net receipts on business, an ad
valorem tax, a tax or charge that is assessed against people or vehicles as they
enter or leave the region, and any tax, direct or indirect, on gaming tables
and devices. Any such proposition must be submitted to the voters of the
district and shall become effective upon approval of the voters voting on the
proposition who reside in the State of California in accordance with the laws
that apply within that state and approval of the voters voting on the
proposition who reside in the State of Nevada in accordance with the laws that
apply within that state. The revenues from any such tax must be used for the
service for which it was imposed, and for no other purpose.
