              <p>A new owner shall be deemed to have
complied with the provisions of subsection 1 if the new owner submits to the
releasing agency, on or before the date by which notification is required in
the agreement for sterilization, a signed affidavit in which the new owner sets
forth a compelling reason why he or she is unable to have the pet sterilized,
including, without limitation, that the pet has been lost or stolen. For the
purposes of this subsection, financial hardship or the negligent or willful
failure of the new owner to have the pet sterilized does not constitute a
compelling reason.
