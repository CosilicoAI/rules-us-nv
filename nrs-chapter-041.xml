                <p>Therefore, the purpose and effect of this
section is to implement the constitutional doctrines of separation of powers

constitutional right of State Legislators to be protected from having to defend
themselves, from being held liable and from being questioned or sanctioned in
administrative or judicial proceedings for speech, debate, deliberation and
other actions performed within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity.

of the crime is conclusive evidence in the civil action that the person

secondary right on the part of one or more shareholders in a corporation or
association, incorporated or unincorporated, because the corporation or
association refuses to enforce rights which may properly be asserted by it, the
complaint must be verified by oath and must aver that the plaintiff was a
shareholder at the time of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains or
that the plaintiffï¿½s share thereafter devolved on the plaintiff by operation of
law. The complaint must also set forth with particularity the efforts of the
plaintiff to secure from the board of directors or trustees and, if necessary,
from the shareholders such action as the plaintiff desires, and the reasons for
the plaintiffï¿½s failure to obtain such action or the reasons for not making
such effort.

after hearing the evidence adduced by the parties at the hearing, that the

upon which the motion is based, the court shall fix the nature and amount of
security to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses, including
attorneyï¿½s fees, which may be incurred by the moving party and the corporation
in connection with such action, including expenses which the corporation may
incur by reason of any obligation which it may have to indemnify its officers
or directors pursuant toNRS 78.7502or
otherwise. A determination by the court that security either must or must not
be furnished or must be furnished as to one or more defendants and not as to
others shall not be deemed a determination of any one or more issues in the
action or of the merits thereof. The corporation and the moving party have
recourse to the security in such amount as the court determines upon the termination
of the action. The amount of the security may thereafter from time to time be
increased or decreased in the discretion of the court upon showing that the
security provided has or may become inadequate or is excessive. If the court,
upon any such motion, makes a determination that security must be furnished by
the plaintiff as to any one or more defendants, the action must be dismissed as
to such defendant or defendants, unless the security required by the court is
furnished within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the court.

              <p>When a plaintiff must demonstrate a
probability of success of prevailing on a claim pursuant toNRS 41.660, the Legislature intends that in
determining whether the plaintiff ï¿½has demonstrated with prima facie evidence a
probability of prevailing on the claimï¿½ the plaintiff must meet the same burden
of proof that a plaintiff has been required to meet pursuant to Californiaï¿½s
anti-Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation law as of June 8, 2015.</p>
