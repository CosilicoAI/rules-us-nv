affirmation as a witness or thereafter refuses to be examined, or is guilty of

an order directing the person to appear before the court and show cause why the
person should not be punished as for contempt. The court order and a copy of
the statement of the Commission shall be served on the person cited to appear.
Thereafter the court has jurisdiction of the matter, and the same proceedings
shall be had, the same penalties may be imposed and the person charged may
purge the contempt in the same way as in the case of a person who has committed
a contempt in the trial of a civil action before a district court.</p>
