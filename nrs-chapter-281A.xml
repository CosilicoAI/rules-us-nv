                <p>It must be presumed that the independence of
judgment of a reasonable person in the public officerï¿½s situation would not be
materially affected by the public officerï¿½s acceptance of a gift or loan,
significant pecuniary interest or commitment in a private capacity to the
interests of another person where the resulting benefit or detriment accruing
to the public officer, or if the public officer has a commitment in a private
capacity to the interests of another person, accruing to the other person, is
not greater than that accruing to any other member of any general business,
profession, occupation or group that is affected by the matter. The presumption
set forth in this paragraph does not affect the applicability of the
requirements set forth in subsection 1 relating to the duty of the public
officer to make a proper disclosure at the time the matter is considered and in
the manner required by subsection 1.

                <p>The Commission must give appropriate weight
and proper deference to the public policy of this State which favors the right
of a public officer to perform the duties for which the public officer was
elected or appointed and to vote or otherwise act upon a matter, provided the
public officer makes a proper disclosure at the time the matter is considered
and in the manner required by subsection 1. Because abstention by a public
officer disrupts the normal course of representative government and deprives the
public and the public officerï¿½s constituents of a voice in governmental
affairs, the provisions of this section are intended to require abstention only
in clear cases where the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in the
public officerï¿½s situation would be materially affected by the public officerï¿½s
acceptance of a gift or loan, significant pecuniary interest or commitment in a
private capacity to the interests of another person.
