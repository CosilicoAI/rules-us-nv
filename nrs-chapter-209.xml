than 15 days after the completion of the investigation of the alleged
violation, whichever is later. A hearing held pursuant to this paragraph must
be presided over by an officer or employee of the Department or private
facility or institution who has no direct involvement in the incident
constituting an alleged violation. At the hearing, the offender must be allowed
to present documentary evidence germane to the alleged violation and to call
one or more witnesses with substantive, relevant knowledge of the issues
involved in the alleged violation except for a witness who has been discharged,
who is not located at the facility or institution where the hearing is being
conducted or who poses a threat to safety or security at the hearing. The
presiding officer or employee may find that the offender committed an
infraction of the rules of the institution or facility only if he or she finds,
based on the evidence presented at the hearing, that there is evidence that the
infraction occurred and that the offender more likely than not committed the
infraction. The presiding officer or employee must provide to the offender a
written statement of the evidence supporting the determination of the presiding
officer or employee unless providing such a written statement would jeopardize
the safety or security of the institution or facility or the safety of the
staff or offenders in the institution or facility. That presiding officer or
employee shall not sanction an offender to disciplinary segregation for a fixed
period. Any period for which the offender is sanctioned to disciplinary
segregation must be expressed in terms of the maximum number of days the
offender may be subjected to disciplinary segregation.
