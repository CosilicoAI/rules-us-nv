              <p>A creditor may not bring an action with
respect to transfer of property to a spendthrift trust unless a creditor can
prove by clear and convincing evidence that the transfer of property was a
fraudulent transfer pursuant tochapter 112of
NRS or that the transfer violates a legal obligation owed to the creditor under
a contract or a valid court order that is legally enforceable by that creditor.
In the absence of such clear and convincing proof, the property transferred is
not subject to the claims of the creditor. Proof by one creditor that a
transfer of property was fraudulent or wrongful does not constitute proof as to
any other creditor and proof of a fraudulent or wrongful transfer of property
as to one creditor shall not invalidate any other transfer of property.
