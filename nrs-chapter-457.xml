          <content>
            <p>The
effective diagnosis, care, treatment and cure of persons suffering from cancer
is affected with the public interest. Vital statistics indicate that
approximately 16 percent of the annual total deaths in the United States result
from one or another of the forms of cancer. It is established that accurate and
early diagnosis of many forms of cancer, followed by prompt application of
methods of treatment which are scientifically proven, either materially reduces
the likelihood of death from cancer or may materially prolong the useful life
of individuals suffering therefrom. It is, therefore, in the interest of
members of the public that they be afforded full and accurate knowledge of the
facilities and methods used for the diagnosis, treatment and cure of cancer
which are available in this state and, to that end, that there be provided
means for testing and investigating cancer devices, drugs, compounds and other
agents, and that the members of the public be informed of facts for their
protection from misrepresentation in such matters.</p>
