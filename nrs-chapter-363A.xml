              <p>To receive the credit authorized by
subsection 1, a taxpayer who intends to make a donation of money to a
scholarship organization must, before making such a donation, notify the
scholarship organization of the taxpayerï¿½s intent to make the donation and to
seek the credit authorized by subsection 1. A scholarship organization shall,
before accepting any such donation, apply to the Department of Taxation for
approval of the credit authorized by subsection 1 for the donation. The
Department of Taxation shall, within 20 days after receiving the application,
approve or deny the application and provide to the scholarship organization
notice of the decision and, if the application is approved, the amount of the
credit authorized. Upon receipt of notice that the application has been
approved, the scholarship organization shall provide notice of the approval to
the taxpayer who must, not later than 30 days after receiving the notice, make
the donation of money to the scholarship organization. If the taxpayer does not
make the donation of money to the scholarship organization within 30 days after
receiving the notice, the scholarship organization shall provide notice of the
failure to the Department of Taxation and the taxpayer forfeits any claim to
the credit authorized by subsection 1.
