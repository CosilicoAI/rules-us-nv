          <content>
            <p>The
terms and provisions of the Compact referred to inNRS 234.130are as follows:
ARTICLE I. Purpose.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The boundary between the States of Arizona and Nevada
on the Colorado River between the point where the Nevada-California state line
intersects the 35th degree of latitude north and Davis Dam has become
indefinite and uncertain because of meanderings in the main channel of the
Colorado River with the result that a state of confusion exists as to the true
and correct location of the boundary and the enforcement and administration of
the laws of the two states have been rendered difficult.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The purpose of this Compact is to fix the location of
the boundary line between the States of Arizona and Nevada on the Colorado
River between the point where the Nevada-California state line intersects the
35th degree of latitude north and Davis Dam.
ARTICLE II.
Description.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The boundary between the States of Arizona and Nevada
on the Colorado River between the point where the Nevada-California state line

the Colorado River which are tied by bearing and distance to establish
monuments and described as follows:
