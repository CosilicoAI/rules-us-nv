              <p>In an action pursuant to this chapter,
the standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence. A finding of guilty
or guilty but mentally ill in a criminal proceeding charging false statement or
fraud, whether upon a verdict of guilty or guilty but mentally ill or a plea of
guilty, guilty but mentally ill or nolo contendere, estops the person found
guilty or guilty but mentally ill from denying an essential element of that
offense in an action pursuant to this chapter based upon the same transaction
as the criminal proceeding.</p>
