deposit with the court a just and reasonable amount to satisfy the obligation,

court shall order the tenant to pay the landlord any rent which is not in

of either party, the court, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, may for
good cause release to either party all or any portion of the rent paid into
court by the tenant. The court shall award the prevailing party the amount owed
