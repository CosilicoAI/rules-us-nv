card for unprofessional conduct of associate.</heading>

            <p>Unprofessional
conduct by an appraiser is not a ground for the revocation or suspension of the
registration card of an intern, or the certificate or license of another
appraiser, who is associated with that appraiser unless it appears to the
satisfaction of the Commission that the associate knew or should have known of
that conduct. A course of conduct which is shown to have been persistently and
consistently followed by the appraiser guilty of unprofessional conduct is prima
facie evidence of that knowledge on the part of the associate.</p>
