            <p>If

this chapter to provide security in the form of cash or a bond, stipulation or
other undertaking with one or more sureties, each surety for that security

affecting the suretyï¿½s liability on the security may be served. The liability
of the surety may be enforced on petition without the necessity of an
independent action. The petition and such notice of the hearing upon the
petition as the court prescribes may be served on the clerk of the court, who
shall mail copies to the surety at the suretyï¿½s last known address.</p>
