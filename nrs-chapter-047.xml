              <p>The judge shall not direct the jury to
find a presumed fact against the accused. When the presumed fact establishes
guilt or is an element of the offense or negatives a defense, the judge may
submit the question of guilt or of the existence of the presumed fact to the
jury, if, but only if, a reasonable juror on the evidence as a whole, including
the evidence of the basic facts, could find guilt or the presumed fact beyond a
reasonable doubt. Under other presumptions, the existence of the presumed fact
may be submitted to the jury if the basic facts are supported by substantial
evidence, or are otherwise established, unless the evidence as a whole
negatives the existence of the presumed fact.
