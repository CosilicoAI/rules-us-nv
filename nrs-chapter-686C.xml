              <p>The Association may abate or defer, in
whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the
Board of Directors, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the
member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. If an assessment against
a member insurer is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which
that assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member
insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in
this section. As soon as the conditions that caused a deferral have been
removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were
deferred pursuant to a plan of repayment approved by the Association.
