              <p>If a female employee requests an
accommodation for a condition of the employee relating to pregnancy, childbirth
or a related medical condition, the employer and employee must engage in a
timely, good faith and interactive process to determine an effective,
reasonable accommodation for the employee. An accommodation may consist of a
change in the work environment or in the way things are customarily carried out
that allows the employee to have equal employment opportunities, including the
ability to perform the essential function of the position and to have benefits
and privileges of employment that are equal to those available to other
employees.

employee for condition relating to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical
condition.</heading>
          <content>
            <p>If an employer grants
leave with pay, leave without pay, or leave without loss of seniority to his or
her employees for sickness or disability because of a medical condition, it is
an unlawful employment practice to fail or refuse to extend the same benefits
to any female employee for a condition of the employee relating to pregnancy,
childbirth or a related medical condition. The female employee who is pregnant must
be allowed to use the leave before and after childbirth, miscarriage or other
natural resolution of her pregnancy, if the leave is granted, accrued or
allowed to accumulate as a part of her employment benefits.</p>
