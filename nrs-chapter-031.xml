ï¿½These exemptions may not apply in certain cases such as proceedings to enforce
a judgment for support of a child or a judgment of foreclosure on a mechanicï¿½s
lien. You should consult an attorney immediately to assist you in determining
whether your property or money is exempt from execution. If you cannot afford
an attorney, you may be eligible for assistance through ....................
(name of organization in county providing legal services to the indigent or
elderly persons). If you do not wish to consult an attorney or receive legal
services from an organization that provides assistance to persons who qualify,
you may obtain the form to be used to claim an exemption from the clerk of the
court.
PROCEDURE
FOR CLAIMING EXEMPT PROPERTY
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ If you believe that the money
or property taken from you is exempt or necessary for the support of you or
your family, you must file with the clerk of the court on a form provided by
the clerk an executed claim of exemption. A copy of the claim of exemption must
be served upon the sheriff, the garnishee and the judgment creditor within 10
days after the notice of execution or garnishment is served on you by mail
pursuant toNRS 21.076which identifies
the specific property that is being levied on. The property must be released by
the garnishee or the sheriff within 9 judicial days after you serve the claim
of exemption upon the sheriff, garnishee and judgment creditor, unless the
sheriff or garnishee receives a copy of an objection to the claim of exemption
and a notice for a hearing to determine the issue of exemption. If this
happens, a hearing will be held to determine whether the property or money is
exempt. The objection to the claim of exemption and notice for the hearing to
determine the issue of exemption must be filed within 8 judicial days after the
claim of exemption is served on the judgment creditor by mail or in person and
served on the judgment debtor, the sheriff and any garnishee not less than 5
judicial days before the date set for the hearing. The hearing must be held
within 7 judicial days after the objection to the claim of exemption and notice
for a hearing is filed. You may be able to have your property released more
quickly if you mail to the judgment creditor or the attorney of the judgment
creditor written proof that the property is exempt. Such proof may include,
without limitation, a letter from the government, an annual statement from a
pension fund, receipts for payment, copies of checks, records from financial
institutions or any other document which demonstrates that the money in your
account is exempt.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE
EXECUTED CLAIM OF EXEMPTION WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED, YOUR PROPERTY MAY BE
SOLD AND THE MONEY GIVEN TO THE JUDGMENT CREDITOR, EVEN IF THE PROPERTY OR
MONEY IS EXEMPT.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ If you received this notice
with a notice of a hearing for attachment and you believe that the money or
property which would be taken from you by a writ of attachment is exempt or
necessary for the support of you or your family, you are entitled to describe
to the court at the hearing why you believe your property is exempt. You may
also file a motion with the court for a discharge of the writ of attachment.
You may make that motion any time before trial. A hearing will be held on that
motion.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE MOTION
BEFORE THE TRIAL, YOUR PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD AND THE MONEY GIVEN TO THE
PLAINTIFF, EVEN IF THE PROPERTY OR MONEY IS EXEMPT OR NECESSARY FOR THE SUPPORT
OF YOU OR YOUR FAMILY.</p>

a third person as the personï¿½s property by a written claim verified by the
personï¿½s oath or that of the personï¿½s agent, setting out the personï¿½s right to

an undertaking executed by at least two good and sufficient sureties in a sum

liable for damages to any such third person for the taking or keeping of such

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ For the purpose of
determining the total number of weeks the employee has worked in the current
calendar year or the total number of weeks the employee worked in the previous
calendar year, as applicable, if the total number of weeks is not exact, the
number must be rounded down if the number of days the employee was on the

rounded up if the number of days the employee was on the payroll of his or her
employer in excess of a whole week is 4 days or more.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Answer:..............................................................................................................
..........................................................................................................................................
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Did you have in your
possession, in your charge or under your control, on the date the writ of
garnishment was served upon you, any money, property, effects, goods, chattels,
rights, credits or choses in action of the defendants, or either of them, or in
which ............................is interested? If so, state its value, and
state fully all particulars.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Answer:..............................................................................................................
..........................................................................................................................................
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Do you know of any
debts owing to the defendants, whether due or not due, or any money, property,
effects, goods, chattels, rights, credits or choses in action, belonging to
............... or in which ...........................is interested, and now
in the possession or under the control of others? If so, state particulars.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Answer:..............................................................................................................
..........................................................................................................................................
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Are you a financial
institution with a personal account held by one or all of the defendants? If
so, state the account number and the amount of money in the account which is
subject to garnishment. As set forth inNRS
21.105, $2,000 or the entire amount in the account, whichever is less, is
not subject to garnishment if the financial institution reasonably identifies
that an electronic deposit of money has been made into the account within the
immediately preceding 45 days which is exempt from execution, including,
without limitation, payments of money described inNRS 21.105or, if no such deposit has been
made, $400 or the entire amount in the account, whichever is less, is not
subject to garnishment, unless the garnishment is for the recovery of money
owed for the support of any person. The amount which is not subject to
garnishment does not apply to each account of the judgment debtor, but rather
is an aggregate amount that is not subject to garnishment.

          <heading>Defendant may except to sufficiency of sureties.</heading>
          <content>
            <p>The defendant may, within 2 days after the
service of the writ and the undertaking, give notice to the sheriff that the
defendant excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties. If the defendant fails to
do so, the defendant shall be deemed to have waived all objection to them. When
the defendant excepts, the sureties shall justify on notice in like manner as
upon bail on arrest; and the sheriff shall be responsible for the sufficiency
of the sureties until the objection to them is either waived, as above
provided, or until they justify. If the defendant excepts to the sureties the
defendant cannot reclaim the property, as provided inNRS 31.890.</p>

          <content>
            <p>At any time before the delivery of the
property to the plaintiff, the defendant may, if the defendant does not except
to the sureties of the plaintiff, require the return thereof, upon the filing
with the court, and serving of a copy upon the plaintiff or the plaintiffï¿½s
attorney, of a written undertaking, approved by the court and executed by two or
more sufficient sureties, to the effect that they are bound in double the value
of the property, as stated in the affidavit of the plaintiff, for the delivery
thereof to the plaintiff, if such delivery be adjudged, and for payment to the
plaintiff of such sum as may for any cause be recovered against the defendant.
If a return of the property is not so required within 5 days after the taking
thereof and the serving of the writ of possession and undertaking upon the
defendant, it shall be delivered to the plaintiff, except as provided inNRS 31.940.</p>

            <p>The
defendantï¿½s sureties, upon notice to the plaintiff of not less than 2 nor more
than 5 days, shall justify before the judge or the clerk in the same manner as

property to the defendant. The sheriff shall be responsible for the defendantï¿½s
sureties until they justify, or until the justification is completed or
expressly waived, and may retain the property until that time. If they or
others in their place, fail to justify at the time and place appointed, the
sheriff shall deliver the property to the plaintiff.</p>

              <p>If the property taken is claimed by any

an affidavit of the personï¿½s title thereto, or right to possession thereof,
stating the grounds of such title or right, and files the affidavit with the
court and serves a copy upon the sheriff, the sheriff is not bound to keep the
property or deliver it to the plaintiff, unless the plaintiff, on demand of the
sheriff or the sheriffï¿½s agent, indemnifies the sheriff against such claim by
an undertaking by two sufficient sureties, accompanied by their affidavits that
they are each worth double the value of the property, as specified in the
affidavit of the plaintiff, over and above their debts and liabilities,
exclusive of property exempt from execution, and are freeholders or
householders in the county. No claim to such property by any other person than
the defendant or the defendantï¿½s agent is valid against the sheriff unless so
made.
