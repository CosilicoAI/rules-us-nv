              <p>Every policy of insurance issued
pursuant tochapters 616Ato617, inclusive, of NRS must contain a provision
for the requirements of subsection 5 and a provision that insolvency or
bankruptcy of the employer or the employerï¿½s estate, or discharge therein, or
any default of the employer does not relieve the insurer from liability for
compensation resulting from an injury otherwise covered under the policy issued
by the insurer.

              <p>No statement in an employerï¿½s
application for a policy of industrial insurance voids the policy as between
the insurer and employer unless the statement is false and would have
materially affected the acceptance of the risk if known by the insurer, but in
no case does the invalidation of a policy as between the insurer and employer
affect the insurerï¿½s obligation to provide compensation to claimants arising
before the cancellation of the policy. If the insurer is required pursuant to
this subsection to provide compensation under an invalid policy, the insurer is
subrogated to the claimantï¿½s rights against the employer.

policy of insurance issued by the insurer pursuant tochapters 616Ato617,

the employer fixing the date on which it is proposed that the cancellation
becomes effective, which must be at least 30 days after the date on which the
notice is personally delivered or mailed to the employer, except in the case of
cancellation for failure to pay a premium when due. The notices must comply
with the provisions ofNRS 687B.310to687B.355, inclusive, and must be
served personally on or sent by first-class mail or electronic transmission to
the employer. If the employer has secured insurance with another insurer which
would cause double coverage, the cancellation must be made effective as of the
effective date of the other insurance.
