crime, environmental decline and poverty, impairs the economic value of large

reduced capacity to pay taxes, and lack of new development to meet the needs of
area residents, and is a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of

              <p>One major cause of this condition has
been recurrent shortages of money from private sources, and such shortages have
contributed to reductions in construction of new residential housing and have
made the sale and purchase of existing residential housing a virtual
impossibility in certain parts of the State. Other causes of this condition
include increases in rental values and decreases in the availability of federal
funding for housing.

              <p>The Division may require in the case of
any lending institution that any required collateral be lodged with a bank or
trust company, located either within or outside the State, designated by the
Division as custodian therefor. In the absence of this requirement, a lending
institution shall, if collateral is to be provided for the loan or securities
purchased, upon receipt of the proceeds from the Division, enter into an
agreement with the Division containing any provisions the Division deems
necessary to identify adequately and maintain and service the collateral and
providing that the lending institution shall hold the collateral as trustee for
the benefit of the Division and shall be held accountable as the trustee of an
express trust for the application and disposition thereof and the income
therefrom solely to the uses and purposes in accordance with the provisions of
the agreement. A copy of the agreement and any of its revisions or supplements,
which revisions or supplements may add to, delete from, or substitute items of
collateral pledged by the agreement, must be filed with the Secretary of State.
The filing shall be deemed to perfect the security interest of the Division in
the collateral and no filing, recording, possession or other action required
under any other law of this state is necessary, and the lien and trust for the
benefit of the Division so created is binding from the time made against all
parties having any prior unperfected claim or claims of any kind in tort,
contract or otherwise or any subsequent security interests against the lending
institution. The Division may also establish any additional requirements the
Administrator deems necessary with respect to the pledging, assigning, setting
aside or holding of the collateral and the making of substitutions for it or
additions to it and the disposition of income and receipts from it.

such safeguards and restrictions as the Administrator may determine. All
expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as part
