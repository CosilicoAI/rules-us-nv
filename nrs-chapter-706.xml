              <p>An operator of a tow car who is issued
a certificate of public convenience and necessity may transfer it to another
operator of a tow car qualified pursuant to the provisions ofNRS 706.011to706.791, inclusive, but no such transfer is
valid for any purpose until a joint application to make the transfer is made to
the Authority by the transferor and the transferee, and the Authority has
authorized the substitution of the transferee for the transferor. The
application must include a complete set of fingerprints of each natural person
who is identified by the Authority as a significant principal, partner,
officer, manager, member, director or trustee of the transferee and written
permission authorizing the Authority to forward the fingerprints to the Central
Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History for submission to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation for its report. No transfer of stock of a corporate
operator of a tow car subject to the jurisdiction of the Authority is valid without
the prior approval of the Authority if the effect of the transfer would be to
change the corporate control of the operator of a tow car or if a transfer of
15 percent or more of the common stock of the operator of a tow car is
proposed.
