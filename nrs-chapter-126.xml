motion of a party, order the mother, child, alleged father or any other person
so involved to submit to one or more tests for the typing of blood or taking of
specimens for genetic identification to be made by a designated person, by
qualified physicians or by other qualified persons, under such restrictions and
directions as the court or judge deems proper. Whenever such a test is ordered
and made, the results of the test must be received in evidence and must be made
available to a judge, master or referee conducting a hearing pursuant toNRS 126.111. The results of the test and
any sample or specimen taken may be used only for the purposes specified in
this chapter. Unless a party files a written objection to the result of a test
at least 30 days before the hearing at which the result is to be received in
evidence, the result is admissible as evidence of paternity without
foundational testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy. The order
for such a test also may direct that the testimony of the experts and of the
persons so examined may be taken by deposition or written interrogatories.

hearing shall evaluate the probability of determining the existence or

must be made to the parties, which may include any of the following:

obligation, fully secured by payment or otherwise, is undertaken by the alleged
father in favor of the child and, if appropriate, in favor of the mother,
subject to approval by the judge, master or referee conducting the hearing. In
reviewing the obligation undertaken by the alleged father in a compromise
agreement, the judge, master or referee conducting the hearing shall consider
the best interest of the child, discounted by the improbability, as it appears
to him or her, of establishing the alleged fatherï¿½s paternity or nonpaternity
of the child in a trial of the action. In the best interest of the child, the
court may order that the alleged fatherï¿½s identity be kept confidential. In
that case, the court may designate a person or agency to receive from the alleged
father and disburse on behalf of the child all amounts paid by the alleged
father in fulfillment of obligations imposed on the alleged father.
