contract for preconstruction services, unless the public body required the
submission of a proposed amount of compensation, in which case the proposed
amount of compensation submitted by the applicant must be the amount offered
for the contract. If the public body or its authorized representative is unable
to negotiate a contract with the most qualified applicant for an amount of
compensation that the public body or its authorized representative and the most
qualified applicant determine to be fair and reasonable, the public body or its
authorized representative shall terminate negotiations with that applicant. The
public body or its authorized representative may then undertake negotiations
with the next most qualified applicant in sequence until an agreement is
reached and, if the negotiation is undertaken by an authorized representative
of the public body, approved by the public body or until a determination is
made by the public body to reject all applicants.

              <p>Except as otherwise provided in
subsection 3, the selection of a construction manager as agent to perform
services pursuant to subsection 1 must be made on the basis of the competence
and qualifications of the construction manager as agent for the type of
services to be performed and not on the basis of competitive fees. If, after
selection of the construction manager as agent, an agreement upon a fair and
reasonable fee cannot be reached with him or her, the public body may terminate
negotiations and select another construction manager as agent. Except as
otherwise provided in this subsection, in assigning the relative weight to each
factor for selecting a construction manager as agent pursuant to this subsection,
the public body shall assign, without limitation, a relative weight of 5
percent to the possession of a certificate of eligibility to receive a
preference when competing for public works. If any federal statute or
regulation precludes the granting of federal assistance or reduces the amount
of that assistance for a particular public work because of the provisions of
this subsection relating to a preference when competing for public works, those
provisions of this subsection do not apply insofar as their application would
preclude or reduce federal assistance for that public work.

certificate of eligibility to receive a preference in bidding on public works
by all contractors on the design-build team if the contractors submit signed
affidavits that meet the requirements of subsection 1 ofNRS 338.0117, and a certificate of
eligibility to receive a preference when competing for public works by all
design professionals on the design-build team, and a relative weight of at
least 30 percent to the proposed cost of design and construction of the public
work. If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting of federal
assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a particular public
work because of the provisions of this subsection relating to a preference in
bidding on public works, or a preference when competing for public works, those
provisions of this subsection do not apply insofar as their application would
preclude or reduce federal assistance for that public work.
