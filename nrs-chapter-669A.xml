              <p>There exists a need to modernize trust
company laws in Nevada to make Nevada more competitive in attracting new
business, for Nevada to remain competitive with a majority of other states that
have modernized their laws and to ensure the safety and soundness of all trust
companies licensed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter orchapter 669of NRS.

            <content>
              <p>Unlike the public trust companies
required to be licensed pursuant to the provisions ofchapter 669of NRS, family trust companies do not
engage or seek to engage in a trust company business with the public but rather
serve solely the interests of members and related parties of a single family
and the grantors and beneficiaries of trust instruments created for the
purposes of estate planning for the family members. Consequently, there is no
public interest to be protected or furthered and requiring the licensing of
family trust companies will not promote the public advantage and convenience.
There are, however, reasons that some family trust companies may wish to obtain
state licensing and appropriate supervision under trust company law.
