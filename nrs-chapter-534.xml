              <p>Upon the initiation of the
administration of this chapter in any particular basin, and where the
investigations of the State Engineer have shown the necessity for the
supervision over the waters of that basin, the State Engineer may employ a well
supervisor and other necessary assistants, who shall execute the duties as
provided in this chapter under the direction of the State Engineer. The
salaries of the well supervisor and the assistants of the well supervisor must
be fixed by the State Engineer. The well supervisor and assistants are exempt
from the provisions ofchapter 284of NRS.

sufficient to pay those salaries, together with necessary expenses, including
the compensation and other expenses of the Well Drillersï¿½ Advisory Board, the
board of county commissioners shall, except as otherwise provided in this
subsection, levy a special assessment annually, or at such time as the
assessment is needed, upon all taxable property situated within the confines of
the area designated by the State Engineer to come under the provisions of this
chapter in an amount as is necessary to pay such salaries and expenses. If the
board of county commissioners determines that the amount of a special
assessment levied upon a property owner pursuant to this section when combined
with the amount of all other taxes and assessments levied upon the property
owner is less than the cost of collecting the special assessment levied pursuant
to this subsection, the board of county commissioners may exempt the property
owner from the assessment and appropriate money from the general fund of the
county to pay the cost of the assessment.
