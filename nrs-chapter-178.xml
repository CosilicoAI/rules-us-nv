court finds that the defendant is suitable to perform supervised community
service, the court may allow the defendant to pay all or part of any expenses
incurred by the county, city or state in providing the defendant with an
attorney by performing supervised community service for a reasonable number of
hours, the value of which would be commensurate with such expenses incurred.
The community service must be performed for and under the supervising authority
of a county, city, town or other political subdivision or agency of the State
of Nevada or a charitable organization that renders service to the community or
its residents. The court may require a defendant who requests to perform
community service to deposit with the court a reasonable sum of money to pay
for the cost of policies of insurance against liability for personal injury and
damage to property or for industrial insurance, or both, during those periods
in which the defendant performs the community service, unless, in the case of
industrial insurance, it is provided by the authority for which the defendant
performs the community service.</p>

            <p>The
Agreement on Detainers, set forth in this section, is hereby enacted into law
and entered into by this State with all other jurisdictions legally joining
such agreement in the form substantially as follows:
The Agreement on
Detainers
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The contracting states solemnly agree that:
Article I
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The party states find that charges outstanding against
a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints,
and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in
other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner
treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states
and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly
disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and
all detainers based on untried indictments, information or complaints. The
party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and
detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in
the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this
agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.
Article II
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ As used in this agreement:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) ï¿½Stateï¿½ shall mean a state of the United
States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United
States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) ï¿½Sending stateï¿½ shall mean a state in which a
prisoner is incarcerated at the time that the prisoner initiates a request for
final disposition pursuant to Article III hereof or at the time that a request
for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV hereof.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) ï¿½Receiving stateï¿½ shall mean the state in
which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to
Article III or Article IV hereof.
Article III
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of
imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and
whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in
any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the
basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, the prisoner
shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after the prisoner
shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the
appropriate court of the prosecuting officerï¿½s jurisdiction written notice of
the place of imprisonment and the prisonerï¿½s request for a final disposition to
be made of the indictment, information or complaint: provided that for good
cause shown in open court, the prisoner or the prisonerï¿½s counsel being
present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or
reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating
the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already
served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good
time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions
of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) The written notice and request for final
disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the
prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having
custody of the prisoner, who shall promptly forward it together with the
certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) The warden, commissioner of corrections or
other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform the
prisoner of the source and contents of any detainer lodged and shall also
inform the prisoner of the right to make a request for final disposition of the
indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) Any request for final disposition made by a
prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final
disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis
of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to
whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically
directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having
custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting
officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the
prisonerï¿½s request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being
initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph
shall be accompanied by copies of the prisonerï¿½s written notice, request, and
the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or
complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the
original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall
not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order
dismissing the same with prejudice.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (e) Any request for a final disposition made by a
prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver
of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or
included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition
to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon the prisoner,
after completion of the term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request
for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the
production of the prisonerï¿½s body in any court where the prisonerï¿½s presence
may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a
further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of
imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in
this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if
otherwise permitted by law.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (f) Escape from custody by the prisoner
subsequent to the prisonerï¿½s execution of the request for final disposition
referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request.
Article IV
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction
in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be
entitled to have a prisoner against whom the officer has lodged a detainer and
who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in
accordance with Article V (a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for
temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state
in which the prisoner is incarcerated: provided that the court having
jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly
approved, recorded and transmitted the request: and provided further that there
shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities
before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending
state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either
upon the governorï¿½s own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) Upon receipt of the officerï¿½s written request
as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the
prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the
term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already
served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good
time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions
of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities
simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the
receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar
certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or
availability and of the reasons therefor.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by
this Article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the
arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in
open court, the prisoner or the prisonerï¿½s counsel being present, the court
having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable
continuance.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) Nothing contained in this Article shall be
construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which the prisoner may have to
contest the legality of the prisonerï¿½s delivery as provided in paragraph (a)
hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the
executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or
ordered such delivery.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (e) If trial is not had on any indictment,
information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisonerï¿½s being
returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V (e)
hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further
force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with
prejudice.
Article V
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) In response to a request made under Article
III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall
offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate
authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is
pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may
be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer
of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article
III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate
authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporar</p>
