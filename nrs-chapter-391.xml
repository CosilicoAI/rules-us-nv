the employee with the opportunity for an informal hearing to address the
circumstances relating to the charges and any other circumstances relating to
the suspension. The superintendent shall issue a written decision concerning
the continuation of the suspension based on the information presented at the
hearing. The employee is entitled to continue to receive his or her salary and
other benefits after the suspension becomes effective until the date on which
the superintendent issues the written decision. The superintendent may
recommend that an employee who has been charged with a felony or a crime
involving immorality be dismissed for another ground set forth inNRS 391.750.

to a school that operates all year, the board shall notify the employee in
writing, in the first, second and third years of the employeeï¿½s probationary
period, no later than 45 days before his or her last day of work for the year

second or third year of the probationary period or for the fourth school year

date of notification of his or her acceptance or rejection of reemployment for
another year. Failure to advise the board of the employeeï¿½s acceptance of
reemployment pursuant to this subsection constitutes rejection of the contract.
