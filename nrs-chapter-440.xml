an order issued by a district court in this State pursuant to subsection 4 ofNRS 126.720validating a gestational
agreement and declaring the intended parent or parents to be the parent or
parents of the resulting child, the State Registrar shall prepare and file a

or parents as the parent or parents of the child and seal and file the order

by a district court in this State for an action which was originally commenced in
this State, a court order concerning a gestational agreement is not valid for
any purpose in this State as it relates to a child born in this State,

birth by the State Registrar.
