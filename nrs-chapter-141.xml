          <heading>Procedure for resigning appointment of personal representative.</heading>
          <content>
            <p>A personal representative may resign the
appointment at any time, by a writing filed with the court, to take effect upon
the settlement of the accounts. If, however, by reason of any delay in the
settlement or for any other cause, the circumstances of the estate or the
rights of those interested therein require it, the court, at any time after the
tendering of the resignation, may revoke the letters of the personal
representative and appoint a successor personal representative in the same
manner as is directed in relation to original letters. The liability of the
previous personal representative or of the sureties on the bond of the personal
representative is not discharged, released or affected by the resignation or
appointment, but continues until the personal representative has delivered up
all the estate to the successor and filed an accounting in accordance withNRS 150.080, and the accounting has been
approved by the court.</p>
