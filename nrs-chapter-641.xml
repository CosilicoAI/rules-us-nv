ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ C.  The home state maintains authority over
the license of any psychologist practicing into a receiving state under the
authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ D.  A psychologist practicing into a
receiving state under the authority to practice interjurisdictional
telepsychology will be subject to the receiving stateï¿½s scope of practice. A
receiving state may, in accordance with that stateï¿½s due process law, limit or
revoke a psychologistï¿½s authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology
in the receiving state and may take any other necessary actions under the
receiving stateï¿½s applicable law to protect the health and safety of the
receiving stateï¿½s citizens. If a receiving state takes action, the state shall
promptly notify the home state and the Commission.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ E.  If a psychologistï¿½s license in any home
state or another compact state or any authority to practice interjurisdictional
telepsychology in any receiving state is restricted, suspended or otherwise
limited, the E.Passport shall be revoked and therefore the psychologist shall
not be eligible to practice telepsychology in a compact state under the
authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology.
ARTICLE V.
Compact Temporary Authorization to Practice
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A.  Compact states shall also recognize the
right of a psychologist, licensed in a compact state in conformance with
Article III, to practice temporarily in other compact states (distant states)
in which the psychologist is not licensed, as provided in the Compact.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ B.  To exercise the temporary authorization
to practice under the terms and provisions of this Compact, a psychologist

within the scope of practice authorized by the distant state.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ D.  A psychologist practicing into a
distant state under the Temporary Authorization to Practice will be subject to
the distant stateï¿½s authority and law. A distant state may, in accordance with
that stateï¿½s due process law, limit or revoke a psychologistï¿½s temporary
authorization to practice in the distant state and may take any other necessary
actions under the distant stateï¿½s applicable law to protect the health and
safety of the distant stateï¿½s citizens. If a distant state takes action, the
state shall promptly notify the home state and the Commission.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ E.  If a psychologistï¿½s license in any home
state or another compact state or any temporary authorization to practice in
any distant state is restricted, suspended or otherwise limited, the IPC shall
be revoked and therefore the psychologist shall not be eligible to practice in
a compact state under the temporary authorization to practice.
ARTICLE VI.
Conditions of Telepsychology Practice in a
Receiving State
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A psychologist may practice in a receiving state under
the authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology only in the
performance of the scope of practice for psychology as assigned by an
appropriate state psychology regulatory authority, as defined in the rules of
the Commission, and under the following circumstances:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A.  The psychologist initiates a
client/patient contact in a home state via telecommunications technologies with
a client/patient in a receiving state; or
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ B.  Other conditions regarding
telepsychology as determined by rules promulgated by the Commission.
ARTICLE VII.
Adverse Actions
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A.  A home state shall have the power to
impose adverse action against a psychologistï¿½s license issued by the home state
and a distant state may take adverse action on a psychologistï¿½s temporary
authorization to practice within that distant state.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ B.  A receiving state may take adverse
action on a psychologistï¿½s authority to practice interjurisdictional
telepsychology within that receiving state. A home state may take adverse
action against a psychologist based on an adverse action taken by a distant
state regarding temporary in-person, face-to-face practice.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ C.  If a home state takes adverse action
against a psychologistï¿½s license, that psychologistï¿½s authority to practice
interjurisdictional telepsychology is terminated and the E.Passport is revoked.
Furthermore, that psychologistï¿½s temporary authorization to practice is
terminated and the IPC is revoked.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ D.  A home stateï¿½s psychology regulatory
authority shall investigate and take appropriate action with respect to
reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a licensee which occurred in a
receiving state as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within
the home state. In such cases, the home stateï¿½s law shall control in determining
any adverse action against a psychologistï¿½s license.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ E.  If a license granted by a compact state
is revoked, surrendered in lieu of discipline or suspended following an
investigation authorized in Article VIII, the authorization to practice
interjurisdictional telepsychology and the temporary authorization to practice
in all compact states shall be terminated upon entry of the final order in the
compact state taking the action.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ F.  Nothing in this Compact shall override
a compact stateï¿½s decision that a psychologistï¿½s participation in an
alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such
participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the compact stateï¿½s law.
Compact states must require psychologists who enter any alternative programs to
not provide telepsychology services under the authority to practice
interjurisdictional telepsychology or provide temporary psychological services
under the temporary authorization to practice in any other compact state during
the term of the alternative program.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ G.  No other judicial or administrative
remedies shall be available to a psychologist in the event a compact state
imposes an adverse action pursuant to section C, above.
ARTICLE VIII.
Additional Authorities Invested in a Compact
Stateï¿½s Psychology Regulatory Authority
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A.  In addition to any other powers granted
under state law, a compact stateï¿½s psychology regulatory authority shall have

and/or the production of evidence from another compact state shall be enforced
in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to that
courtï¿½s practice and procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own
proceedings. The issuing state psychology regulatory authority shall pay any
witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service
statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence are located; and

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ B.  During the course of any investigation,
a psychologist may not change his or her home state licensure. A home state
psychology regulatory authority is authorized to complete any pending investigations
of a psychologist and to take any actions appropriate under its law. The home
state psychology regulatory authority shall promptly report the conclusions of
such investigations to the Commission. Once an investigation has been
completed, and pending the outcome of said investigation, the psychologist may
change his or her home state licensure. The Commission shall promptly notify
the new home state of any such decisions as provided in the rules of the
Commission. All information provided to the Commission or distributed by
compact states pursuant to the psychologist shall be confidential, filed under
seal and used for investigatory or disciplinary matters. The Commission may
create additional rules for mandated or discretionary sharing of information by
compact states.
ARTICLE IX.
Coordinated Licensure Information System
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A.  The Commission shall provide for the

Compact is applicable in all compact states as defined by the rules of the
Commission.

Coordinated Database any information concerning the criminal history of a
licensee that is obtained from a report received from the Central Repository
for Nevada Records of Criminal History or the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ E.  Compact states reporting information to
