district cannot be sold, or if at any time it shall be deemed in the best
interests of the district to withdraw from sale all or any portion of an
authorized bond issue, the board of directors may cancel the bonds and levy
assessments in the amount of the bonds cancelled. The revenue derived from the
assessments must be employed for the same purpose as was contemplated by the
bond authorization, but no levy may be made to pay for work or material,
payment for which was contemplated by bonds which have been authorized, until
