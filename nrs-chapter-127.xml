            <p>Upon the entry of an order of adoption, the
child shall become the legal child of the persons adopting the child, and they
shall become the childï¿½s legal parents with all the rights and duties between
them of natural parents and legitimate child. By virtue of such adoption the
child shall inherit from his or her adoptive parents or their relatives the
same as though the child were the legitimate child of such parents, and in case
of the death of the child intestate the adoptive parents and their relatives
shall inherit the childï¿½s estate as if they had been the childï¿½s natural
parents and relatives in fact. After a decree of adoption is entered, any
parent who has signed a relinquishment or given consent to terminate his or her
parental rights is relieved of all parental responsibilities for the adopted
child and shall not exercise or have any rights over the adopted child or the
property of the adopted child. The child does not owe a parent whose parental
rights have been terminated any legal duty and may not inherit from a parent
whose parental rights have been terminated or his or her kindred.
Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary in this section, the
adoption of a child does not in any way change the status of the relationship
between the child and any legal parent who is a petitioner and whose parental
rights have not been terminated.</p>

confirmation of the natural parentsï¿½ intent to place the child for adoption and

for adoption is filed within 6 months after the completion of the investigation
required by this subsection. If a child-placing agency undertakes the
investigation, it shall provide progress reports to the agency which provides
child welfare services in such a format and at such times as the agency which
provides child welfare services requires to ensure that the investigation will
be completed within the 60-day period. If, at any time, the agency which
provides child welfare services determines that it is unlikely that the
investigation will be completed in a timely manner, the agency which provides
child welfare services shall take over the investigation and complete it within
the 60-day period or as soon thereafter as practicable.

            <p>The
Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children is as follows:
INTERSTATE COMPACT ON
THE PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN
ARTICLE I. Purpose and
Policy
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ It is the purpose and policy of the party states to
cooperate with each other in the interstate placement of children to the end
that:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) Each child requiring placement receives the
maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or
institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a
necessary and desirable degree and type of care.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) The appropriate authorities in a state where
a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the
circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with
applicable requirements for the protection of the child.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) The proper authorities of the state from
which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the
basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for
the care of children are promoted.
ARTICLE II.
Definitions
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ As used in this compact:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) ï¿½Childï¿½ means a person who, by reason of
minority, is legally subject to parental control, guardianship or similar
control.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) ï¿½Placementï¿½ means the arrangement for the
care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency
or institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally
ill, mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational
in character, and any hospital or other medical facility.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) ï¿½Receiving stateï¿½ means the state to which a
child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public
authorities or private persons or agencies, and whether for placement with
state or local public authorities or for placement with private agencies or
persons.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) ï¿½Sending agencyï¿½ means a party state, officer
or employee thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or employee
thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation, association,
charitable agency or other entity which sends, brings or causes to be sent or
brought any child to another party state.
ARTICLE III.
Conditions for Placement
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) A sending agency shall not send, bring or
cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement
in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending
agency complies with each and every requirement set forth in this article and
with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of
children therein.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any
child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care
or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish
the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the
intention to send, bring or place the child in the receiving state. The notice
must contain:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (1) The name, date and place of birth of
the child.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (2) The identity and address or addresses
of the parents or legal guardian.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (3) The name and address of the person,
agency or institution to or with which the sending agency proposes to send,
bring or place the child.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (4) A full statement of the reasons for
the proposed action and evidence of the authority pursuant to which the
placement is proposed to be made.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) Any public officer or agency in a receiving
state which is in receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this article
may request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or agency
of or in the sending agencyï¿½s state, and is entitled to receive therefrom, such
supporting or additional information as it considers necessary under the
circumstances to carry out the purpose and policy of this compact.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) The child must not be sent, brought or caused
to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public
authorities in the receiving state notify the sending agency, in writing, to
the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the
interests of the child.
ARTICLE IV. Penalty
for Illegal Placement
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The sending, bringing or causing to be sent or brought
into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact
is a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the
state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings
the child and of the receiving state. Such a violation may be punished or
subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition
to liability for any such punishment or penalty, the violation constitutes full
and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit
or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or
allows it to place or care for children.
ARTICLE V. Retention
of Jurisdiction
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) The sending agency retains such jurisdiction
over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody,
supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child as it would have had
if the child had remained in the sending agencyï¿½s state, until the child is
adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the
concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. That
jurisdiction also includes the power to effect or cause the return of the child
or the transfer of the child to another location and custody pursuant to law.
The sending agency continues to have financial responsibility for support and
maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained
in this article defeats a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient
to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) When the sending agency is a public agency,
it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in
the receiving state to provide one or more services to the child as the agent
for the sending agency.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) Nothing in this compact prevents a private
charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from
performing services or acting as the agent in that state for a private
charitable agency of the sending state, or to prevent the agency in the
receiving state from discharging its financial responsibility for the support
and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency
without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a).
ARTICLE VI.
Institutional Care of Delinquent Children
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an
institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such
placement may be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to
the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to the child being
sent to the other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds
that:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) Equivalent facilities for the child are not
available in the sending agencyï¿½s jurisdiction; and
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) Institutional care in the other jurisdiction
is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.
ARTICLE VII. Compact
Administrator
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The executive head of each jurisdiction party to this
compact shall designate an officer to act as the administrator and general
coordinator of activities under this compact in his or her jurisdiction and
who, acting jointly with like officers of other party jurisdictions, may adopt
regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this
compact.
ARTICLE VIII.
Limitations
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ This compact does not apply to:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) The sending or bringing of a child into a
receiving state by his or her parent, stepparent, grandparent, adult brother or
sister, adult uncle or aunt or his or her guardian and leaving the child with
any such relative or nonagency guardian in the receiving state.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) Any placement, sending or bringing of a child
into a receiving state pursuant to any other interstate compact to which both
the state from which the child is sent or brought and the receiving state are
parties, or to any other agreement between the states which has the force of
law.
ARTICLE IX. Enactment
and Withdrawal
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ This compact is open to joinder by any state, territory
or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico, and, with the consent of Congress, the Government of Canada or
any province thereof. It becomes effective with respect to any jurisdiction
when the jurisdiction has enacted it into law. Withdrawal from this compact
must be by the enactment of a statute repealing it, but does not take effect
until 2 years after the effective date of the statute and until written notice
of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing jurisdiction to the
executive head of each other party jurisdiction. Withdrawal of a party
jurisdiction does not affect the rights, duties and obligations under this
compact of any sending agency in that jurisdiction with respect to a placement
made prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
ARTICLE X.
Construction and Severability
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The provisions of this compact must be liberally construed
to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact are
severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is
declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the Un</p>

Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance is as follows:
INTERSTATE COMPACT ON
ADOPTION
AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
ARTICLE I. FINDINGS
The states which are parties to this compact find that:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) In order to obtain adoptive families for
children with special needs, states must assure prospective adoptive parents of
substantial assistance (usually on a continuing basis) in meeting the high
costs of supporting and providing for the special needs and the services
required by such children.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) The states have a fundamental interest in
promoting adoption for children with special needs because the care, emotional
stability, and general support and encouragement required by such children can
be best, and often only, obtained in family homes with a normal parent-child
relationship.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) The states obtain fiscal advantages from
providing adoption assistance because the alternative is for the states to bear
the higher cost of meeting all the needs of children while in foster care.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) The necessary assurances of adoption
assistance for children with special needs, in those instances where children
and adoptive parents live in states other than the one undertaking to provide
the assistance, include the establishment and maintenance of suitable
substantive guarantees and workable procedures for interstate cooperation and
payments to assist with the necessary costs of child maintenance, the
procurement of services, and the provision of medical assistance.
ARTICLE II. PURPOSES
The purposes of this compact are to:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) Strengthen protections for the interests of
children with special needs on behalf of whom adoption assistance is committed
to be paid, when such children are in or move to states other than the one
committed to provide adoption assistance.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) Provide substantive assurances and operating
procedures which will promote the delivery of medical and other services to
children on an interstate basis through programs of adoption assistance
established by the laws of the states which are parties to this compact.
ARTICLE III.
DEFINITIONS
As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires
a different construction:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) ï¿½Child with special needsï¿½ means a minor who
has not yet attained the age at which the state normally discontinues
childrenï¿½s services, or a child who has not yet reached the age of 21 where the
state determines that the childï¿½s mental or physical handicaps warrant the
continuation of assistance beyond the age of majority, for whom the state has
determined the following:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (1) That the child cannot or should not be
returned to the home of his or her parents;
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (2) That there exists with respect to the
child a specific factor or condition (such as his or her ethnic background,
age, or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors
such as medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because
of which it is reasonable to conclude that the child cannot be placed with
adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance; or
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (3) That, except where it would be against
the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of
significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in their
care as a foster child, a reasonable but unsuccessful effort has been made to
place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption
assistance.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) ï¿½Adoption assistanceï¿½ means the payment or
payments for the maintenance of a child which are made or committed to be made
pursuant to the program of adoption assistance established by the laws of a
party state.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) ï¿½Stateï¿½ means a state of the United States,
the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or a territory or
possession of the United States.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) ï¿½Adoption assistance stateï¿½ means the state
that is signatory to an agreement of adoption assistance in a particular case.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (e) ï¿½Residence stateï¿½ means the state in which
the child is a resident by virtue of the residence of the adoptive parents.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (f) ï¿½Parentsï¿½ means either the singular or plural
of the word ï¿½parent.ï¿½
ARTICLE IV. ADOPTION
ASSISTANCE
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) Each state shall determine the amounts of
adoption assistance and other aid which it will give to children with special
needs and their adoptive parents in accordance with its own laws and programs.
The adoption assistance and other aid may be made subject to periodic
reevaluation of eligibility by the adoption assistance state in accordance with
its laws.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) The adoption assistance, medical assistance,
and other services and benefits to which this compact applies are those
provided to children with special needs and their adoptive parents from the
effective date of the agreement for adoption assistance.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) Every case of adoption assistance must
include a written agreement for adoption assistance between the adoptive
parents and the appropriate agency of the state undertaking to provide the
adoption assistance. Every such agreement must contain provisions for the
fixing of actual or potential interstate aspects of the assistance so provided
as follows:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (1) An express commitment that the
assistance so provided must be payable without regard for the state of
residence of the adoptive parents, both at the outset of the agreement and at
all times during its continuance;
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (2) A provision setting forth with
particularity the types of care and services toward which the adoption
assistance state will make payments;
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (3) A commitment to make medical
assistance available to the child in accordance with Article V of this compact;
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (4) An express declaration that the
agreement is for the benefit of the child, the adoptive parents and the state
and that it is enforceable by any or all of them; and
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (5) The date or dates upon which each
payment or other benefit provided thereunder is to commence, but in no event
prior to the effective date of the agreement for adoption assistance.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) Any services or benefits provided for a child
by the residence state and the adoption assistance state may be facilitated by
the party states on each otherï¿½s behalf. To this end, the personnel of the
child welfare agencies of the party states will assist each other, as well as
the beneficiaries of agreements for adoption assistance, in assuring prompt and
full access to all benefits expressly included in such agreements. It is
further recognized and agreed that, in general, all children to whom agreements
for adoption assistance apply will be eligible for benefits under the child
welfare, education, rehabilitation, mental health, and other programs of their
state of residence on the same basis as other resident children.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (e) Payments for adoption assistance on behalf of
a child in another state shall be made on the same basis and in the same
amounts as they would be made if the child were living in the state making the
payments, except that the laws of the adoption assistance state may provide for
the payment of higher amounts.
ARTICLE V. MEDICAL
ASSISTANCE
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) Children for whom a party state is committed,
in accordance with the terms of an agreement of adoption assistance to provide
federally aided medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act,
are eligible for such medical assistance during the entire period for which the
agreement is in effect. Upon application therefor, the adoptive parents of a
child who is the subject of an agreement of adoption assistance must receive a
document of identification for medical assistance made out in the childï¿½s name.
The identification must be issued by the program of medical assistance of the
residence state and must entitle the child to the same benefits, pursuant to
the same procedures, as any other child who is covered by the program of
medical assistance in that state, whether or not the adoptive parents are
themselves eligible for medical assistance.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) The document of identification must bear no
indication that an agreement of adoption assistance with another state is the
basis for its issuance. However, if the document of identification is issued
pursuant to an agreement for adoption assistance, the records of the issuing
state and the adoption assistance state must show the fact, and must contain a
copy of the agreement for adoption assistance and any amendment or replacement
thereof, as well as all other pertinent information. The adoption assistance
and programs of medical assistance of the adoption assistance state shall be
notified of the issuance of such identification.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) A state which has issued a document of
identification for medical assistance pursuant to this compact, which
identification is valid and currently in force, shall accept, process and pay
claims for medical assistance thereon as it would with other claims for medical
assistance by eligible residents.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) The federally aided medical assistance
provided by a party state pursuant to this compact must be in accordance with
paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Article. In addition, when a child who is
covered by an agreement of adoption assistance is living in another party
state, payment or reimbursement for any medical services and benefits specified
under the terms of the agreement of adoption assistance, which are not
available to the c</p>
