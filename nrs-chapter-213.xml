Legislature finds and declares that the release or continuation of a person on
parole or probation is an act of grace of the State. No person has a right to
parole or probation, or to be placed in residential confinement, and it is not
intended that the establishment of standards relating thereto create any such
right or interest in liberty or property or establish a basis for any cause of
action against the State, its political subdivisions, agencies, boards,
commissions, departments, officers or employees.</p>

          <content>
            <p>The
Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision is hereby ratified, enacted
into law and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining in the
Compact, in substantially the form set forth in this section:
ARTICLE I. PURPOSE
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (1) The compacting states to this Interstate
Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult
offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules
of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting
state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer
supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary
return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (2) The compacting states also recognize that
Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has
authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual
assistance in the prevention of crime.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (3) It is the purpose of this compact and the
Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative
action among the compacting states to provide the framework for the promotion
of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and
regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community, to provide
for the effective tracking, supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders
by the sending and receiving states, and to equitably distribute the costs,
benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (4) In addition, this compact will create an
Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the
movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and
released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling
authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will
promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact, ensure an opportunity
for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined
offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines, establish
a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by
authorized criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact
activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial and
legislative branches and criminal justice administrators, monitor compliance
with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate
interventions to address and correct noncompliance, and coordinate training and
education regarding regulation of interstate movement of offenders for
officials involved in such activity.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (5) The compacting states recognize that there is
no right of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited
officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there
apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions
of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (6) It is the policy of the compacting states
that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are
the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.
ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ As used in this compact, unless the context clearly
requires a different construction:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (1) ï¿½Adultï¿½ means both individuals legally
classified as adults and juveniles treated as adults by court order, statute or
operation of law.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (2) ï¿½Bylawsï¿½ means those bylaws established by
the Interstate Commission for its governance or for directing or controlling
the Interstate Commissionï¿½s actions or conduct.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (3) ï¿½Compact administratorï¿½ means the individual
in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact
responsible for the administration and management of the stateï¿½s supervision
and transfer of offenders subject to the terms of this compact, the rules
adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the State Council
under this compact.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (4) ï¿½Compacting stateï¿½ means any state which has
enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (5) ï¿½Commissionerï¿½ means the voting

this compact.
