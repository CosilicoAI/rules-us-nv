blighted areas cannot be accomplished by private enterprise alone, without
public participation and assistance in the acquisition of land, in planning and
in the financing of land assembly, in the work of clearance, and in the making
of improvements necessary therefor, it is in the public interest to employ the
power of eminent domain, to advance or expend public funds for these purposes,
and to provide a means by which blighted areas may be redeveloped or
rehabilitated.

connection with the taxation of the property by the taxing agency, last
equalized before the effective date of the ordinance, must be allocated to and
when collected must be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as
taxes by or for such taxing agencies on all other property are paid. To allocate
taxes levied by or for any taxing agency or agencies which did not include the
territory in a redevelopment area on the effective date of the ordinance but to
which the territory has been annexed or otherwise included after the effective
date, the assessment roll of the county last equalized on the effective date of
the ordinance must be used in determining the assessed valuation of the taxable
property in the redevelopment area on the effective date. If property which was
shown on the assessment roll used to determine the amount of taxes allocated to
the taxing agencies is transferred to the State and becomes exempt from
taxation, the assessed valuation of the exempt property as shown on the
assessment roll last equalized before the date on which the property was
transferred to the State must be subtracted from the assessed valuation used to
determine the amount of revenue allocated to the taxing agencies.
