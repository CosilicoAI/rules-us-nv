proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein
shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies
of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.
ARTICLE VI—Federal Aid
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid
for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or
may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate
in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such
federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states
have made contractual provision; provided, that if such program or activity is
not part of the customary correctional regimen the express consent of the
appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.
ARTICLE VII—Entry Into Force
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ This compact shall enter into force and become
effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into
law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and
become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action
by such state.
ARTICLE VIII—Withdrawal and Termination
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ This compact shall continue in force and remain binding
upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and
providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the
compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual
withdrawal shall not take effect until 1 year after the notices provided in
said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing
state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of
withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall
remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have
confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.
ARTICLE IX—Other Arrangements Unaffected
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to
abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may
have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of
inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of
cooperative institutional arrangements.
ARTICLE X—Construction and Severability
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The provisions of the compact shall be liberally
construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision
of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any
participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any
government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the
remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government,
agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact
shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein,
the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states
and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable
matters.</p>
