elections or presidential preference primary elections, the list of offices and
candidates and the statements of measures to be voted on for each mechanical
recording device, except those devices intended solely for nonpartisan voters,
must be so arranged that it contains a page or pages setting forth the ballot
of one major political party only. For a primary election, the page or pages
setting forth the ballot of one major political party must be followed by a
page or pages setting forth the nonpartisan ballot and so that the voter may
cast partisan and nonpartisan votes on a single ballot but may not cast
partisan votes for a candidate of another major political party.</p>
