to the power of the court to ensure a fair trial by granting a continuance or

fails to return the personal property to such place within the time specified,
and who, with the intent to defraud the lessor or to retain possession of such
property without the lessorï¿½s permission, thereafter fails to return such
property to any place of business of the lessor within 72 hours after a written
demand for the return of such property is made upon the person by registered
mail addressed to his or her address as shown in the written agreement, or in
the absence of such address, to his or her last known place of residence, is
guilty of larceny and shall be punished as provided inNRS 205.2175to205.2705, inclusive. The failure to return
the personal property to the place specified in the agreement is prima facie
evidence of an intent to defraud the lessor or to retain possession of such
property without the lessorï¿½s permission. It is a complete defense to any civil
action arising out of or involving the arrest or detention of any person upon
whom such demand was made that the person failed to return the personal
property to any place of business of the lessor within 20 days after such
demand.</p>
