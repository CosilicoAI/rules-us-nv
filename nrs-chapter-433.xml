          <content>
            <p>The
Interstate Compact on Mental Health is hereby ratified, enacted into law and
entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining in the Compact, in
substantially the form set forth in this section:
INTERSTATE COMPACT ON
MENTAL HEALTH
The contracting states solemnly agree that:
ARTICLE I.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The party states find that the proper and expeditious
treatment of persons with mental illness and mental deficiencies can be
facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their
families and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the
necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no
primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on
the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism
require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need
of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this Compact and of the party
states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or
other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient
under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and
to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.
ARTICLE II.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ As used in this Compact:
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) ï¿½Aftercareï¿½ means care, treatment and
services provided to a patient on convalescent status or conditional release.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) ï¿½Institutionï¿½ means any hospital or other
facility maintained by a party state or political subdivision thereof for the
care and treatment of mental illness or mental deficiency.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) ï¿½Mental deficiencyï¿½ means mental deficiency
as defined by appropriate clinical authorities to such extent that a person so
afflicted is incapable of managing himself or herself and his or her affairs,
but does not include mental illness as defined herein.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) ï¿½Mental illnessï¿½ means mental disease to such
extent that a person so afflicted requires care and treatment for his or her
own welfare, or the welfare of others, or of the community.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (e) ï¿½Patientï¿½ means any person subject to or
eligible as determined by the laws of the sending state, for
institutionalization or other care, treatment or supervision pursuant to the
provisions of this Compact.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (f) ï¿½Receiving stateï¿½ means a party state to
which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the Compact or to
which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (g) ï¿½Sending stateï¿½ means a party state from
which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the Compact or
from which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (h) ï¿½Stateï¿½ means any state, territory or
possession of the United States, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico.
ARTICLE III.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) Whenever a person physically present in any
party state is in need of institutionalization by reason of mental illness or
mental deficiency, he or she is eligible for care and treatment in an
institution in that state irrespective of his or her residence, settlement or
citizenship qualifications.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this
Article to the contrary notwithstanding, any patient may be transferred to an
institution in another state whenever there are factors based upon clinical
determinations indicating that the care and treatment of said patient would be
facilitated or improved thereby. Any such institutionalization may be for the
entire period of care and treatment or for any portion or portions thereof. The
factors referred to in this paragraph include the patientï¿½s full record with
due regard for the location of the patientï¿½s family, character of the illness
and probable duration thereof and such other factors as are considered
appropriate.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) No state is obliged to receive any patient
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Article unless the sending
state has given advance notice of its intention to send the patient, furnished
all available medical and other pertinent records concerning the patient and
given the qualified medical or other appropriate clinical authorities of the
receiving state an opportunity to examine the patient if said authorities so
wish and the receiving state agrees to accept the patient.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) In the event that the laws of the receiving
state establish a system of priorities for the admission of patients, an
interstate patient under this Compact must receive the same priority as a local
patient and must be taken in the same order and at the same time that he or she
would be taken if he or she were a local patient.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (e) Pursuant to this Compact, the determination
as to the suitable place of institutionalization for a patient may be reviewed
at any time and such further transfer of the patient may be made as seems
likely to be in the best interest of the patient.
ARTICLE IV.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) Whenever, pursuant to the laws of the state
in which a patient is physically present, it is determined that the patient
should receive aftercare or supervision, such care or supervision may be
provided in a receiving state. If the medical or other appropriate clinical
authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in
the sending state have reason to believe that aftercare in another state would
be in the best interest of the patient and would not jeopardize the public
safety, they shall request the appropriate authorities in the receiving state
to investigate the desirability of affording the patient such aftercare in said
receiving state, and such investigation must be made with all reasonable speed.
The request for investigation must be accompanied by complete information
concerning the patientï¿½s intended place of residence and the identity of the
person in whose charge it is proposed to place the patient, the complete
medical history of the patient and such other documents as may be pertinent.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) If the medical or other appropriate clinical
authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in
the sending state and the appropriate authorities in the receiving state find
that the best interest of the patient would be served thereby, and if the
public safety would not be jeopardized thereby, the patient may receive
aftercare or supervision in the receiving state.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) In supervising, treating or caring for a
patient on aftercare pursuant to the terms of this Article, a receiving state
shall employ the same standards of visitation, examination, care and treatment
that it employs for similar local patients.
ARTICLE V.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Whenever a dangerous or potentially dangerous patient
escapes from an institution in any party state, that state shall promptly
notify all appropriate authorities within and without the jurisdiction of the
escape in a manner reasonably calculated to facilitate the speedy apprehension
of the escapee. Immediately upon the apprehension and identification of any such
dangerous or potentially dangerous patient, he or she must be detained in the
state where found pending disposition in accordance with law.
ARTICLE VI.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The duly accredited officers of any state party to this
Compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the
patient, must be permitted to transport any patient being moved pursuant to
this Compact through any and all states party to this Compact, without
interference.
ARTICLE VII.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) No person shall be deemed a patient of more
than one institution at any given time. Completion of transfer of any patient
to an institution in a receiving state has the effect of making the person a
patient of the institution in the receiving state.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) The sending state shall pay all costs of and
incidental to the transportation of any patient pursuant to this Compact, but
any two or more party states may, by making a specific agreement for that
purpose, arrange for a different allocation of costs as among themselves.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (c) No provision of this Compact shall be
construed to alter or affect any internal relationships among the departments,
agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a
party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs or
responsibilities therefor.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (d) Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to
prevent any party state or subdivision thereof from asserting any right against
any person, agency or other entity in regard to costs for which such party
state or subdivision thereof may be responsible pursuant to any provision of
this Compact.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (e) Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to
invalidate any reciprocal agreement between a party state and a nonparty state
relating to institutionalization, care or treatment of the mentally ill or
mentally deficient, or any statutory authority pursuant to which such
agreements may be made.
ARTICLE VIII.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)
of this Article, nothing in this Compact shall be construed to abridge, diminish
or in any way impair the rights, duties and responsibilities of any patientï¿½s
guardian on his or her own behalf or in respect of any patient for whom he or
she may serve.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)
of this Article, where the transfer of any patient to another jurisdiction
makes advisable the appointment of a supplemental or substitute guardian, any
court of competent jurisdiction in the receiving state may make such
supplemental or substitute appointment and the court which appointed the
previous guardian shall, upon being duly advised of the new appointment and
upon the sa</p>
