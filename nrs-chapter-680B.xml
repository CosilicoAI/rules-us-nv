pursuant to an agreement which provides for an accumulation of money to
purchase annuities at future dates may be considered as ï¿½total income derived
from direct premiums writtenï¿½ either upon receipt or upon the actual
application of the money to the purchase of annuities, but any interest
credited to money accumulated while under the latter alternative must also be
included in ï¿½total income derived from direct premiums written,ï¿½ and any money
taxed upon receipt, including any interest later credited thereto, is not
subject to taxation upon the purchase of annuities. Each life insurer shall
signify on its return covering premiums for the calendar year 1971 or for the
first calendar year it transacts business in this State, whichever is later,
its election between those two alternatives. Thereafter an insurer shall not
change his or her election without the consent of the Commissioner. Any such
money taxed as ï¿½total income derived from direct premiums writtenï¿½ is, in the
event of withdrawal of the money before its actual application to the purchase
of annuities, eligible to be included as ï¿½return premiumsï¿½ pursuant to the
provisions ofNRS 680B.030.</p>
