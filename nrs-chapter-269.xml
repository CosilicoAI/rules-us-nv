to an unincorporated town whose population is less than 25,000, and which

unincorporated town by ordinance adopted by the town board or the board of
county commissioners. The ordinance must contain a provision requiring that the
town boundary be surveyed, mapped, platted and so enlarged as to include the
area to be annexed. Upon filing of the plat or map of the town, including the
area annexed, it constitutes the legal boundary of the town.</p>
