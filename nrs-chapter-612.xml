amount equal to one twenty-fifth of the personï¿½s total wages for employment by
employers during the quarter of the personï¿½s base period in which the total
wages were highest, but not less than $16 per week, nor more than the maximum
weekly benefit amount determined as follows: On or before the first day of July
of each year, the total wages reported for the preceding calendar year by
employers subject to the provisions of this chapter must be divided by the
average of the 12 midmonth totals of all workers in employment for employers as
reported in that year. The average annual wage thus obtained must be divided by
52 and the average weekly wage thus determined must be rounded to the nearest
cent. Fifty percent of that average weekly wage, rounded to the nearest lower
multiple of $1, if not a multiple of $1, constitutes the maximum weekly benefit
amount. In making this calculation, any tips which were included in reported
wages must be excluded.

              <p>An unemployed person may file a request
for a determination of the personï¿½s benefit status in accordance with
regulations prescribed by the Administrator. Upon such request, the
Administrator shall furnish the person with a written determination. If it is
determined that the claimant is an insured worker, the determination must
include a statement as to the amount of wages for insured work paid to the
claimant by each employer in his or her base period, and the employers by whom
those wages were paid. It must include also the claimantï¿½s benefit year, his or
her weekly benefit amount and the maximum amount of benefits that may be paid
to the claimant for his or her unemployment during the benefit year. All
base-period employers of a claimant must be notified promptly when a claimant
files a request for determination of his or her benefit status which results in
a determination that the claimant is an insured worker.

rate of contributions is 2.95 percent of wages paid by each employer during the
calendar year with respect to employment. Each employer who becomes subject to
the law on or after the first day of the first calendar quarter after February
25, 1965, shall pay contributions at a rate of 2.95 percent until such time as

              <p>For the purposes ofNRS 612.535,612.540and612.606, wages do not include that part of
the wages paid for employment to a person by an employer during any calendar
year which exceeds 66 2/3 percent of the average annual wage, rounded to the
nearest hundred dollars, for the preceding calendar year unless that part of
the wages is subject to a tax under a federal law imposing a tax against which
credit may be taken for contributions paid under this chapter. The average
annual wage for employers who do not elect reimbursement in lieu of contributions
must be computed as follows: On or before July 1, the total wages reported for
the preceding calendar year by those employers who are subject to the
provisions of this chapter must be divided by the average of the 12 mid-month
totals of all workers in employment for employers as reported in that year.

subsection must be paid not later than 30 days after a bill is mailed to the
last known address of the employing unit or electronically transmitted to the
employing unit. If payment is not made on or before the date due and payable,
the whole or any part thereafter remaining unpaid bears interest at the rate of

not paid, may be collected by the Administrator, together with interest and

from the Administrator is conclusive and binding on the employing unit, unless
not later than 15 days after the bill was mailed to its last known address or
electronically transmitted to it, the employing unit files an application for
redetermination. A redetermination made under this subsection is subject to
petition for hearing and judicial review in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter. Payments made by any nonprofit organization, political
subdivision or Indian tribe under the provisions of this section must not be
deducted, in whole or in part, from the wages of any person employed by that

              <p>At any time within 15 days after the
mailing of the notice of assessment, the employer affected thereby may file a
verified petition with the Administrator praying for readjustment of the
assessment so levied. At the time of filing the petition the employer upon whom
an assessment is levied shall deposit a bond executed by him or her as
principal, and by a corporation qualified under the laws of this State as
surety, payable to the State of Nevada and conditioned upon the employerï¿½s
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The amount of the bond must be
determined by the Administrator in such a manner as the Administrator deems
proper. In lieu of a bond, the employer may deposit with the Administrator a
like amount of lawful money of the United States or any other form of security
authorized byNRS 100.065. If security
is provided in the form of a savings certificate, certificate of deposit or
investment certificate, the certificate must state that the amount is not
available for withdrawal except upon order of the Administrator.

the collection of any contribution computed under the provisions of law will be
jeopardized by delay, the Administrator may immediately assess the contribution
together with all forfeit and interest which may have accrued, whether or not

Upon assessment, the contribution is immediately due, the contributions
together with all forfeit and interest which may have accrued are immediately
payable, and notice of demand for payment must be made upon the employer for
the payment thereof. Upon failure or refusal to pay the assessed contribution,
forfeit and interest, collection thereof may be enforced according to the
