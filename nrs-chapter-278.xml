              <p>In a county whose population is less
than 100,000, if the parcel map shows an area totaling 50 acres or more that is
subject to a conservation easement, the preparer of the map shall cause the
approved map to be recorded in the office of the county recorder within 3 years
after the date the map was approved or deemed approved, unless the governing
body grants an extension of time for recording the map, which may not exceed 1
year. As used in this subsection, ï¿½conservation easementï¿½ means an easement
that permanently preserves or protects open space, a floodplain or agricultural
land from being parceled, subdivided or otherwise developed in a manner
incompatible with the preservation or protection of the open space, floodplain
or agricultural land.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ State law requires
construction to be done by licensed contractors. You have applied for a permit
under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your
property, to act as your own contractor with certain restrictions although you
do not have a license.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ You must directly supervise
the construction, on the job, yourself. The building or residence must be for
your own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for
sale or lease. If you sell or lease a building you have built or substantially
improved yourself within 1 year after the construction is complete, it is
presumed that you built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which
is a violation of this exemption and a violation ofchapter
624of NRS.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ You may not hire an
unlicensed person to act as your contractor or to supervise people working on
your building. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by
you have the licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing
ordinances. You may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a
contractor unless the contractor is licensed to perform the work being done.
Any person working on your building who is not licensed must work under your
direct supervision and must be employed by you, which means that you must
deduct FICA and withholding tax and provide industrial insurance and pay the
required contribution for unemployment compensation for that employee, and
comply with other state and federal laws relating to employment. Your
construction must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes
and zoning regulations.</p>
